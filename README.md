This repository contains middleware handlers that work with either Swagger 2.0 or OpenAPI 3.0 specification. If you are starting a brand new project, it is highly recommended using the OpenAPI 3.0 specification for your design.

To get started your first project, please visit the [getting started](https://doc.networknt.com/getting-started/light-rest-4j/) to walk through the process.

For documentation on the handlers, please visit the [reference document](https://doc.networknt.com/style/light-rest-4j/).

There are also numeric [tutorials](https://doc.networknt.com/tutorial/rest/) to show users how to build Restful services.
